## Getting Started

This repository provides multiple buses to work with RabbitMQ. When working with RabbitMQ, there are scenarios where you might need to interact with two separate RabbitMQ instances or connections. One instance might be dedicated to consuming messages from a queue, while another might be responsible for publishing messages to a different queue or exchange. To handle such cases, you can use a concept called a "Second Bus." In this context, a "bus" refers to a messaging bus that abstracts the complexities of connecting to and interacting with RabbitMQ, making it easier to manage messaging operations in your application. By setting up a second bus, you can maintain two separate connections to two different RabbitMQ instances. This approach is particularly useful when you want to isolate the message-consuming logic from the message-publishing logic. Below is a detailed code example demonstrating how you can implement a second bus in your application to interact with two different RabbitMQ setups: one for consuming messages and another for publishing messages.
